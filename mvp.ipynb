    "## About the Project\n",
    "In 2011 The CDC created the social vulnerability index (SVI).  The SVI is a scale that predicts the vulnerability of a population in the event of an emergency or natural disaster. COVID is the first global pandemic since the development of this measure. We evaluated the association between SVI score and COVID case count between San Antonio and Dallas, Texas.  Using modeling, we were able to identify localized community-specific and highly vulnerable subgroups.  It was observed that the most vulnerable subgroups in San Antonio included persons over 25 years of age with no high school diploma, minority status (non-white), institutional group homes, and those who are generally unemployed.  In Dallas, these groups focused on minority populations, those over 25 years of age with no high school diploma, and individuals that are identified as having limited English proficiency (LEP).  While SVI shared a strong correlation (.55) with COVID case count per 100k in San Antonio, this correlation was not observed in Dallas (.19).  This finding suggests that resources would be well allocated in San Antonio using the SVI index, but in Dallas, that correlation does not hold. We hope that our work helps to better inform our local government about specific sub-populations were aid allocation should be prioritized.\n",

    "### Background\n",
    "The SVI (Social Vulnerability Index) was developed to help city governments and first responders predict areas that are particularly vulnerable in emergencies to prioritize resources to help regions at high risk (CDC's Social Vulnerability Index, 2020). The CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (CDC SVI) uses 15 U.S. census variables to classify census tracts with a composite score between 0 and 1 (lower scores = less vulnerability, higher score = greater vulnerability. This score is calculated by first ranking every census tract, in every country, in every state, in the United States. Those ranked tracks are then broken up into four themes (socioeconomic status, household composition, disability, minority status and language, household type, and transportation) and reclassified.  This overall score is then tallied by summing the themed percentiles and ranked between 0 and 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While SVI was designed to help city governments respond to emergencies, the systems' efficacy has never been tested in response to a global pandemic. COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of 'viral pneumonia' in Wuhan, People's Republic of China. (World Health Organization, 2020). As of 9 December 2020, more than 68.4 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 1.56 million deaths attributed to COVID-19. \n",
    "\n",
    "Separated by 274 miles San Antonio and Dallas are two cities that share both comparable population sizes and SVI scores. Cities will be evaluated separately and then together for comparison.  "

    "**Data Collection** \n",
    "- What data, if we had it, would solve the problem right away?\n",
    "    - Cases count per 100K by census tract with SVI metrics nationally would be ideal\n",
    "- What data do we have access to?\n",
    "    - Have SVI from CDC by census track\n",
    "    - Have Bexar county case count per 100K by zip code for single date 12/8/20\n",
    "    - Collected median case count by zip code from Dallas dashboard on 12/8/20\n",
    "- What additional data would be good to have?\n",
    "    - be great to have more data by zip code instead of only county level\n",
    "- What data would be impossible to collect?\n",
    "    - due to privacy/panic concerns case data at the census tract level is not being published for open access\n",
    "- What are the best proxies you can find for unavailable or impossible data?\n",
    "    - find a way to translate from census tract to zip code\n",
    "- What are the legal or ethical issues you might run into if you were to try to collect all of the types of data you would like to work with?\n",
    "    - considered web scraping for zip code level data where specific information is not available\n",
    "    - likely better to hard code existing data that is publicly available\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning Model**\n",
    "- What ML paradigm are you working in? (Classification, Regression, Clustering, etc)\n",
    "    - Regression - target continuous variable cases per 100k\n",
    "    - Classification - redefine target variable into 4 ranks/classes\n",
    "- What models are commonly used in this task?\n",
    "    - Linear Regression, LassoLars, Polynomial Features, Tweedie Regressor, etc.\n",
    "    - Random Forest, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), etc.\n",
    "* What other solutions are being tried in this field?\n",
    "    - Did not see other research related to SVI as predictor for pandemic specifically\n",
    "    - Index is used commonly for Hurricanes\n",
    "* What special considerations need to be taken when dealing with these models? (i.e., imbalanced classes, text preprocessing, data leakage, etc)\n",
    "    - possibly imbalanced classes in classification modeling, will need to verify distribution\n",
    "* How will you know that your models work?\n",
    "    - Establish a Baseline for each type of model \n",
    "    - Regression: will predict the mean value and calculate the MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n",
    "    - Regression: compare MAE of model vs baseline, model works is it has lower MAE than baseline\n",
    "    - Classification: predict the most common rank for all observations and take the percentage that are correct\n",

Using the HUD crosswalk we found the Zip Code that accounted for the highest percentage of addresses within the tract and assigned that as the tract's sole Zip Code.

The bin_svi column returns a label (low, low-mod, mod-high, high) in relation to the raw_svi score, while the rank_svi column is a numeric representation of SVI (1 representing a high score, four representing a low score). Prepared data was split into train and test for later modeling with cross-validation.  Numeric columns were scaled using sklearn's MinMaxScaler.  Six data frames were returned at the end of wrangle, including *train_explore* for exploration and individual scaled data frames for modeling  *X_train_scaled, y_train, X_test_scaled, y_test*."

Due to the difference in variance in the data we performed a non-parametric ANOVA test (Kruskal). The confidence interval was set at 99% and returned a p-value less than alpha, requiring us to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis that the average number of COVID-19 cases per 100k is significantly different across all CDC SVI range categories.\n",

This test also returned a p-value less than alpha, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis that there * a statistically significant difference* between raw_svi and cases per 100K.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then visualized the distribution of cases and SVI scores. When viewed with hue = svi_cat distinct boundaries were observed separating range categories. Dispersed clustering within categories was observed, with the most significant variation occurring in the 'low' SVI vulnerability category. Several observations within this category were located outside the IQR and identified as outliers. We decided to keep these outliers in the dataset for further investigation time permitting.\n",

    "The relationships between the distribution of cases and the number of specific SVI flags were examined.

These features were e_pov (the estimate of persons below poverty), ep_pov (the percentage of persons below poverty), and spl_theme1 (the sum of features associated with socioeconomic themes).  These features were combined into a new feature identified as poverty_cluster.  This feature, along with centroids, were added to the data frame for modeling. "

This suggests that SVI is useful in predicting vulnerable communities during this pandemic and that SVI values should be examined as modeling features.\n",

    "Based on a Pearson R correlation test, we are 99% confident that there is a correlation between raw_svi and the number of cases per 100k in San Antonio and Dallas. This correlation does not suggest causation yet describes a linear relationship that exists between the two features. This relationship is characterized by a strong correlation in San Antonio (0.54) and a weaker yet still significant correlation in Dallas (0.19).\n",

Three of the top features were derived from looking at how the SVI score has changed over time. In San Antonio, the top four features identified as necessary in predicting count per 100k included total socioeconomic themes, the change in SVI for minority and language subgroups, the change in SVI status between 2014 – 2018, and the average SVI score between 2014 -2018.\n",

In Dallas, the top four features identified as necessary in predicting count per 100k included the centroids of persons below poverty, percent of persons below poverty, and the scaled count of total socioeconomic themes. The only significant factor that was not derived from clustering was derived from the SVI change over time, the difference in SVI for minority and language subgroup.\n",

    "These observations suggest that changes in SVI have a considerable influence on how our models perform. Local governments should consider the shift in SVI score over time when thinking about the distribution of aid, as communities that have seen improvement in SVI scores between 2014-2018 are less likely to need the number of resources that communities with stagnant scores will require.\n",

    "5. Are the features identified in modeling consistent across communities (similar size and SVI score)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In San Antonio and Dallas, COVID cases per 100k are greatest in communities where most residents are of minority status and lack educational opportunities (individuals >25 and no diploma). What is different about these two cities is the predictive ability SVI has on COVID case count. In San Antonio, resources would be well allocated using the SVI index, but in Dallas, that correlation does not hold. For two cities with the same approximate SVI score and population, this is an interesting observation that will require further research to understand better. Regardless we hope that our work helps to better inform our local government about specific sub-populations where aid allocation should be prioritized.\n"
